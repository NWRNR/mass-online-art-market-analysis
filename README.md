# Analysis of the Mass Online Art Market

This project analyzes pricing structures, market positioning, and platform dynamics within the mass online art market.  
It was completed as the Capstone Project for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

## Business Question
How does the mass online art market respond to different artwork characteristics and presentation conditions, and which market factors can help independent artists improve sales outcomes without compromising artistic identity?

## Data Sources
- Public marketplace listing data from Etsy  
- Publicly available platform and social proof indicators  
- Aggregated listing-level information (pricing, format, reviews, activity patterns)

## Tools & Skills
- Google Sheets (data cleaning, pivot tables, visualization)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (price bands, format classification)
- Data visualization and analytical storytelling

## Key Areas of Analysis
- Price distribution across mass-market art listings
- Art vs non-art market structure
- Digital vs physical artwork formats
- Relationship between price and social proof indicators
- Identification of outliers and platform-driven effects

## Key Takeaway
The analysis highlights that market visibility and outcomes in mass online art platforms are strongly influenced by structural and platform-driven factors such as pricing bands, format, and accumulated social proof, rather than artistic style alone.
